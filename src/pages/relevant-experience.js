      During my studies, I have interned at four different companies in France,
      Luxemboug and South Korea. I am really used to work in a multicultural
      environment. After I graduated, I have worked as a web developer for two
      years at Asiance, a digital agency located in <strong>Seoul</strong>. I
      also have <strong>worked in Tokyo</strong> as a front-end developer for
      two digital agencies. I initially joined Netwise for eight months and then
      I worked at Cream for roughly one year. I've made web applications and
      responsive websites for <strong>worldwide clients</strong> like Lacoste or
      Air France. I also have contributed to unconventional projects like the
      Lausane University Hospital's interactive map.

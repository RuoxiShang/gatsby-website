        I am a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher and a 2nd year PhD student in 
        {' '}<Anchor href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/">Human Centered Design & Engineering Department at University of Washington</Anchor>{' '}, 
        advised by Dr. Gary Hsieh and Dr. Chirag Shah. 
        My reserach interest is in Human-centered Explainable AI, 
        and my most recent work is about understanding end-users' needs in the explainability 
        of intelligent decision-support systems. 
        Before coming into HCDE, I studied Applied Mathematics and Statistics. I had fun with a few Applied Data Science 
        research projects around building Machine Learning and Deep Neural Network predictive models.

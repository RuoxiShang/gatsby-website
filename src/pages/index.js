        Hi, Iâ€™m Anna. 
        I am a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher and a 2nd year PhD student in 
        {' '}<Anchor href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/">Human Centered Design & Engineering Department at University of Washington</Anchor>{''}. 
        My reserach interest is in human-centered explainability of intelligent systems and Human-AI interaction. My most recent work is about understanding 
        lay users' needs in why-not explanations for recommended content in everyday 
        intelligent applications.
        Before coming into HCDE, I studied Applied Mathematics and Statistics. I had fun with a few Applied Data Science 
        research projects around building Machine Learning and Deep Neural Network predictive models.
